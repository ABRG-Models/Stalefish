# Stalefish

## Dependencies

This program links to
[morphologica](https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica) (and thus
to the associated libraries armadillo, opencv and hdf5). So head over
to that page and follow the instructions to build and install
morphologica.

## Compile Stalefish using cmake

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ABRG-Models/Stalefish.git
cd Stalefish
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## Running the program

run using e.g.,:
```
./build/src/stalefish ./data/testimg.json
```

The JSON file contains a list of the images to fit curves to, and some
other parameters.

Left-click points to which a curve should be fit. Bezier curves fit
best to 4 or 5 points; pressing space will create a new curve to fit;
the program will ensure they join nicely. Sliders give control over
the size and shape of the bins.

## Analysing the data from the program

See the reading/ subdirectory and its README.md file.

## JSON parameters

* **pixels_per_mm** Set to the number of pixels per mm in the original image files.
* **thickness** The thickness of a brain slice (in mm), assuming they'll all be the same.
* **bg_blur_screen_proportion**: Float. Typically 1/6 (0.1667). The sigma for the Gaussian used to blur the image to get the overall background luminance is the framewidth in pixels multiplied by this number.
* **bg_blur_subtraction_offset**: Float. Range 0.0 to 255.0. Typically 180. A subtraction offset used when subtracting blurred background signal from image
* **colourmodel**: Enumerated. Options are *monochrome* (default) or *Allen*
* **colour_rot** Array related to Allen colour images
* **colour_trans** Array related to Allen colour images
* **ellip_axes** Array (of 2 numbers) related to Allen colour images
* **luminosity_cutoff**: Float. No longer used in monochrome mode.
* **luminosity_factor**: Float. No longer used in monochrome mode.
* **save_per_pixel_data**: Boolean. If true, save coordinates and signal value for every pixel in every sample box. Inflates .h5 file somewhat
* **save_auto_align_data**: Boolean. If true, save the slice auto-alignment location data
* **save_landmark_align_data**: Boolean. If true, save the slice landmark-alignment location data
* **save_frame_image**: Boolean. If true, save all images in .h5 file.
* **scaleFactor**: Float. By what factor should the images given in **slices** be scaled before they are shown in the UI. This is intended to allow you to scale down your images so that they fit within the resolution of your screen, or so that the data files generated by the program are kept in check. By scaling down the image size, the number of data points saved by the program is reduced, especially when **save_per_pixel_data** is set true
* **rotate_landmark_one**: Boolean. If true, and there are >1 landmark per slice, apply the *rotate slices about landmark 1* alignment procedure anyway. This rotational alignment is applied by default if there is ONLY 1 landmark per slice.
* **rotate_align_landmarks**: Boolean. If true, in "rotate about landmark 1 mode" align the other landmarks, instead of the curves.
* **slices**: Array of JSON objects specifying slice images **filename** and the slice's **x** position.
